# nico-helper
A small base project for easily expandible Nico games.
Simply clone this repo as a base and run `nimble install`. Then just add to the `globalinfo.Gamestate` enum for each level. Finally create a new level inside of the `/levels/` and with the same format as the included levels. Adding the macro to add levels.
